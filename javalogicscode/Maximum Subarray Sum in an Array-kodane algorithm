Kadane’s Algorithm:

           
 * it's actually solving a subproblem, saving the solution somewhere,
        and then the next time the same subproblem occurs, 
            rather than solving it again, using the previous solution from the memory.


QSTN:   Kadane’s Algorithm : Maximum Subarray Sum in an Array


PSEUDOCODE:
       
     * initialize overall max sum.
     * temporary sum
     * for loop use iterate sum
     *  tempsum and max sum find
