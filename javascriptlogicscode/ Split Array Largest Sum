Split Array Largest Sum:

               
Pseudocode:

        1.split value find min and max value of the sum.
        2.binary search use to find max and min.
        3.check and split array for current sum(m).
        4.compare min and max ....find that value count numnber fot min and max m value for the sum.
        5.max and min value to low/high (mid+1) find pair count value fot he sum and return ans.

MY NOTES:

  1)   Math floor ():
             
            * The Math.floor() static method always rounds down and returns the largest integer less
                than or equal to a given number.
