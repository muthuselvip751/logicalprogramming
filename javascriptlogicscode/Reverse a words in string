Pseudocode:
      1)string legnthfind and stored in N 
      2)loop the string value and iterate reduce that legth value(n-1)
      3)split that string value.
      4)rev and trim use print that word rev order
      




code:
    
var reverseWords = function(s) {    
    let reverse = '';
    let words = s.split(' ');
    
    for( let i = words.length-1; i >= 0; i-- ) {
         if( words[i] == '' ) {
             continue;
         } 
         reverse += words[i] + ' ';               
    }

1)What is StringBuilder vs string?
     * String is immutable whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes.
2)string builder:
     * StringBuilder objects are like String objects, except that they can be modified.

3)Why do we use StringBuilder?

    * StringBuilder class can be used when you want to modify a string without creating a new object. 
    * For example, using the StringBuilder class can boost performance when concatenating many strings together in a loop.



charAt() method returns the character at the specified index in a string.
